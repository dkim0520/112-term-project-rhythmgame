TP Project Proposal

Project Description: 
    Name: PyRhythm Platformer
    Description: Using beat and pitch detection, along with loading .osu files
                 from the popular rhythm game "Osu!", I plan on creating a rhythm
                 platformer akin to the mobile game "The Impossible Game."

Competitive Analysis:
    

Structural Plan:
    I plan on having a core file that runs the PyGame run function itself, while
    having other files that correspond to the beat detection itself, the loading
    of a particular media file, and a function(s) that parse through the .osu
    file data and translates that to something PyGame can work with.


Algorithmic Plan:
